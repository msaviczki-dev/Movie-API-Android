# FreeCast Challenge

## General Info

Legacy code can be a significant challenge for development teams, and at FreeCast, we are no exception. To overcome this challenge, we believe in hiring top-tier developers who can bring fresh perspectives and innovative ideas to the table.

As part of our rigorous hiring process, we will present you with a real-world challenge that we are currently facing. This challenge will provide you with an opportunity to demonstrate your problem-solving skills and showcase your expertise in dealing with legacy code and layout problems.

If you are up for the challenge and ready to make a difference, we encourage you to apply to our team at FreeCast. Here, we believe that the best solutions arise from collaboration and diverse perspectives. We do not discriminate against any candidate in our hiring process. We welcome candidates from all backgrounds and encourage a diverse pool of applicants to apply.

Here you'll find a very basic app, with no set architecture, doing some network calls with one trailer and one recycler view.

You will need to get a free API Key from the TheMovieDB to complete this challenge.

Youâ€™re free to change everything (dependencies, gradle, classes, modules, and/or anything else you want).

## The Challenge

Refactor the existing app so it allows the user to:

- [X] Watch one random trailer from any source (this can be a static link)
- [X] See trending movies
- [X] See the top series for a certain category that will be chosen by the user
- [X] Click on any item (TV Show or Movie) and see the details screen with related data

The layout must have:

- [X] A trailer (using ExoPlayer)
- [X] The two lists mentioned above
- [X] Poster, rating, description and title on the details screen

What do we expect?

- [X] A lightweight and intuitive layout
- [X] Good code practices
- [X] Good architecture
- [X] The use of SOLID principles
- [X] Unit tests
