# FreeCast Challenge

Legacy code can be a significant challenge for development teams, and at FreeCast, we are no exception. To overcome this challenge, we believe in hiring top-tier developers who can bring fresh perspectives and innovative ideas to the table.

As part of our rigorous hiring process, we will present you with a real-world challenge that we are currently facing. This challenge will provide you with an opportunity to demonstrate your problem-solving skills and showcase your expertise in dealing with legacy code and layout problems.

If you are up for the challenge and ready to make a difference, we encourage you to apply to our team at FreeCast. Here, we believe that the best solutions arise from collaboration and diverse perspectives. We do not discriminate against any candidate in our hiring process. We welcome candidates from all backgrounds and encourage a diverse pool of applicants to apply.

Firstly, we have out starting app that is very basic, with no architecture on it, and doing some network calls that has one trailer and one recycler view.
You will need to get one API Key from the Api (TheMovieDB) to start this challenge.

Remembering that you’re free to change everything (dependencies, gradle, classes, modules).

# The challenge is:

Refactor the existing app that allows the user to be able to:
- [ ] watch one random trailer from any source (this can be a static link;
- [ ] see the trending movies;
- [ ] see the top 10 series of a certain category that will be chosen by the user;
- [ ] click on any item (TvShow or Movie) and see the details screen with related data. ?? Maybe use this on medium/senior positions…

The layout must have:
- [ ] Trailer (using ExoPlayer);
- [ ] The two lists commented above;

What do we expect (for all levels)?
- [ ] A lightweight and intuitive layout;
- [ ] Good code practices;
- [ ] Good architecture;
- [ ] The use of SOLID principles;
- [ ] Tests
